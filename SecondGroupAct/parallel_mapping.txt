Define the Work Unit

- In the computational model, a single patient triage record is defined as the smallest independent unit of computation. 
This unit includes measuring vital signs, recording symptoms, assigning a priority level, and saving the record. 
Because these steps are repeated uniformly for every patient, each triage record can be processed independently of others.

Identify System Constraints

- Parallel execution in the clinic triage model is limited by several practical constraints. 
The electronic medical record system functions as a shared resource that requires synchronized access, creating a critical section in the workflow. 
Physical triage equipment, such as blood pressure monitors and thermometers, may be limited in number, leading to contention among workers. 
Additionally, coordination overhead and thread management costs restrict how efficiently the system can scale as more workers are added.

Select and Justify the Parallel Strategy

- Data parallelism is the most suitable optimization strategy for the clinic triage desk. 
Each patient represents an independent unit of data that undergoes the same triage procedure, allowing multiple workers to process different patients concurrently. 
Synchronization is only necessary when accessing shared resources such as patient records, making data parallelism both effective and realistic for this scenario.
