- In a typical clinic environment, the triage desk serves as the first point of patient intake. A single triage nurse is usually 
responsible for the entire triage process, which includes collecting patient information, measuring vital signs, conducting symptom interviews, 
and assigning a priority level. Each patient must complete all these steps before the next patient can be accommodated, resulting in a strictly sequential workflow.

What Is the Current Bottleneck?

- The primary bottleneck in this system is the reliance on a single triage nurse to process all patients from start to finish. 
During peak clinic hours, patients form long queues because only one patient can be assessed at any given time, regardless of how simple or repetitive the triage tasks may be.

Why It Limits Efficiency

- The triage desk limits efficiency because vital sign collection, symptom documentation, and preliminary assessment are largely independent across patients 
but are forced to occur sequentially. Since a single nurse performs all triage activities end-to-end, overall throughput is constrained by individual processing speed. 
As patient volume increases, waiting times grow significantly even though multiple patients could be assessed simultaneously without compromising accuracy or safety.

Type of Parallelism Required

The most appropriate improvement strategy for this system is data parallelism. Each patient represents an independent data entity undergoing the same set of triage operations. 
By allowing multiple workers to process different patients concurrently using identical procedures, throughput can be increased without altering the logical structure of the 
triage process.
